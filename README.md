# ðŸŒŠ WavyArch
### I have just realised how awful my bash scripting is, I will probably refactor in the future
Bash script I use after a fresh installation of Arch to setup my environment and install applications.

> **Note**:
> This script has been configured to work with the `linux-zen` kernel. You may encounter issues 

### Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WaviestBalloon/WavyArch.git
cd WavyArch
chmod +x ./wavyarch.sh
./wavyarch.sh
```
> **Warning**: 
> Do not run this script as **sudo**! It will prompt you when it requires sudo permissions.
